# Instagram-Confessions
Users submit 'confession' to a web form which gets sent to server that converts confession into a picture and then posts it on Instagram.


Whole thing runs in one script. Requires:
- InstagramAPI
- Pillow
- textwrap3

Web form should be hosted on a website that allows php scripts to be run. I used 000webhostapp and it worked fine.
